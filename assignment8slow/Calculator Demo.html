			<ul>
				<li>This is the low navigating speed version of my one-key interface. The fast version of my one-key interface is the other url link in my Moodle submission.</li>
				<li>I designed a one-key interface. I used a timer to navigate through all of the keys and when the user want to press a key he just need to press ‘Enter’. </li>
				<li>I designed my test as 4 math equations that need to be input by my one-key interface. The equations are: (13*22+, 4/14-22, 90-88+3, 31/2*33).I input the 4 equations 3 times and computed the average time as a measurement of my interface performance. I have two set of conditions. The first set is slow navigate speed vs fast navigate speed. The second set is right hand vs left hand.</li>
				<li>Average time in fist set of conditions: is 3 minutes 6 seconds vs 3 minutes. Average time in second set of conditions: is 2 minutes 55 seconds vs 2 minutes 40 seconds. Average number of errors in first set of conditions: 4 vs 12. Average number of errors in second set of conditions(slow mode): 4 vs 5.</li>
				<li>Conclusion: At first I thought the fast version will beat the slow version in performance. But as we can see in the result, the average time used between them is not very different. And we can see that the error for the fast version is very larger than that in the slow version. Therefore we can see that stability of a user interface is much more important than speed. Increasing of input speed will lead to a high error rate. In my second set of conditions we see that the different is not very obvious. The reason is that we only use one-key to manage our functions so it does not matter whether the user is a left hand user or right hand user.</li>
